          Multi-agent systems multiply model calls, and conversational frameworks multiply them the hardest. Every
          agent typically sees the whole transcript, so context grows with each turn and cost grows faster than
          linearly in the number of turns.

            Turn 12 sends everything from turns 1 through 11 as input. Summed across the run, total input tokens grow
            roughly with the square of the turn count. A loop that fails to terminate does not merely hang — it bills.
