          "Making the model smaller" is not one problem. Techniques that look interchangeable in a list attack
          different resources, and confusing them leads to the most common planning mistake: quantizing a model
          heavily, then running out of memory anyway because the KV cache was the real constraint.

            <strong>Try this.</strong> Take the 70B model at fp16 with full multi-head attention and push the context
            to 128k — the cache alone dwarfs the weights. Now switch to grouped-query attention, which almost every
            modern model already uses, and watch the same number collapse. GQA is the single largest KV saving
            available and it is already in the architecture you are using.
