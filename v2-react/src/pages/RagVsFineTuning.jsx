          "Should we use RAG or fine-tune?" is asked constantly and answers nothing, because the two address
          unrelated deficits. One supplies knowledge the model lacks. The other changes behaviour the model already
          has. Asking which is better is like asking whether a dictionary beats an accent coach.

            <strong>The most common expensive mistake</strong> is fine-tuning to teach facts. It technically works and
            it is a bad trade: the facts go stale the moment the run finishes, cannot be cited, cannot be
