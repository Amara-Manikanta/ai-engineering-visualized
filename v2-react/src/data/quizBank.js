      {
        q: "A random forest's trees are individually deep and overfit. Why is that the design rather than a flaw?",
        options: [
          "Deep trees train faster than shallow ones",
          "Averaging cancels variance but cannot fix bias, so each learner should be low-bias",
          "Deep trees are more interpretable when combined",
          "Shallow trees cannot handle categorical features",
        ],
        answer: 1,
        why: "Averaging independent errors drives variance down, and it leaves bias roughly where it was. So you want learners as flexible as possible, each overfitting in a different direction, and let the average cancel the noise. Boosting makes the opposite bet: weak, high-bias learners corrected sequentially.",
      },
      {
        q: "You raise a random forest from 100 to 1000 trees and accuracy barely moves. What does the ensemble variance formula say is happening?",
        options: [
          "The trees have become correlated with each other",
          "The variance floor is ρσ², which no number of trees removes",
          "The model has run out of training data",
          "n_estimators has a hard internal limit",
        ],
        answer: 1,
        why: "Variance of the average is ρσ² + (1−ρ)σ²/n. Only the second term shrinks with n. Past a few hundred trees it is already negligible and you are sitting on the floor set by ρ. Lowering ρ — which is exactly what random feature selection at each split does — is the only lever left.",
      },
      {
        q: "Which statement about adding more trees is true?",

          "Both random forests and gradient boosting overfit with too many trees",

          "A boosted model is mostly safe; a random forest will overfit",
        ],
        answer: 2,
        why: "Bagged trees are averaged, so extra trees mainly cost time. Boosted trees are summed, each one fitting the previous residuals, so the model keeps growing in complexity and will eventually fit noise. That asymmetry is why boosting needs early stopping and bagging does not.",

        ],
        answer: 1,
        why: "Each bootstrap sample leaves roughly a third of rows unused for that tree. Scoring each row using only the trees that never saw it produces an honest held-out estimate at no extra data cost. It is close to cross-validation for free.",

        ],
        answer: 1,
        why: "Training accuracy cannot distinguish them, so you need another criterion. Distance to the nearest point is a proxy for how much a test point can differ before crossing the boundary. Maximising it is a generalisation argument, not a fitting one.",

        answer: 0,
        why: "The optimiser only ever needs dot products between points. A kernel returns the dot product in the lifted space directly, so the lift is never materialised. That is what makes an infinite-dimensional feature space affordable.",

        answer: 1,

          "Pooling is no longer necessary",
        ],
        answer: 1,
        why: "Two things at once. Translation equivariance means an edge detector works anywhere without relearning, and the parameter count depends only on kernel size and channel count rather than on resolution. That is why a convolutional layer is tractable where a dense layer on pixels is not.",

        answer: 1,
        why: "⌊(32 + 2·1 − 3) / 1⌋ + 1 = 32. Kernel 3 with padding 1 and stride 1 preserves spatial size exactly, which is why that combination — 'same' padding — is so common in modern architectures.",

          "They make the network translation invariant",
        ],
        answer: 1,
        why: "Writing a block as y = f(x) + x means the gradient reaches x through the identity term even when f's gradient is tiny. That is the same structural idea as an LSTM's cell state, and it is what took usable depth past about twenty layers.",

          "Sequences that long exceed the batch size",
        ],
        answer: 1,
        why: "The gradient reaching step 1 from step t scales roughly as wᵗ. Anything below 1 vanishes exponentially, anything above explodes. At 50 steps with w = 0.9 the signal is about 0.005 of its original size — no learning reaches that far back.",

          "It is larger than the hidden state",

        ],
        answer: 1,
        why: "c_t = f_t ⊙ c_(t−1) + i_t ⊙ c̃_t. The route from c_(t−1) to c_t involves no weight matrix — only the forget gate. If the network learns to hold that gate near 1, gradients pass through nearly unchanged.",

        ],
        answer: 1,

        ],
        answer: 1,
        why: "B·A is zero when B is zero, so the model at step one is exactly the pretrained model. Training starts from a known-good point rather than from randomly damaged weights, which is why LoRA needs no repair warmup.",

        q: "Which saving from LoRA most often decides whether a project is feasible?",

        ],
        answer: 1,
        why: "Gradients and Adam moments exist only for trainable parameters. Cutting trainable parameters by three orders of magnitude removes most of the training-time memory, which is what moves a large fine-tune onto hardware you actually have. Inference speed is unchanged, and the file size is merely convenient.",

        answer: 1,

        ],
        answer: 1,
        why: "The vocabulary includes all the atomic units, so any string has at least one valid segmentation. A rare word simply costs more tokens. Byte-level BPE takes this further and can encode literally any byte sequence.",

        ],
        answer: 1,
        why: "WordPiece scores candidates by freq(ab) / (freq(a)·freq(b)), which asks whether a pair co-occurs more than chance would predict. BPE just counts. The second question is better at distinguishing a real morpheme from two common pieces that happen to sit next to each other.",

          "The tokenizer strips repeated letters",
        ],
        answer: 1,
        why: "It is a representation problem, not a reasoning one. You are asking about something that is not in the input the model receives. No amount of prompting fixes it; spelling the word out with spaces does, because that changes the tokenization.",

        answer: 1,
        why: "The lost-in-the-middle effect is well documented and does not go away with larger context windows. Less padding means less middle for the relevant material to get buried in, so accuracy often rises even where budget was never the constraint.",

      answer: 1,
      why: "The reward model is an imperfect proxy. Optimise it without limit and the policy drifts into answers the proxy over-scores — length, flattery — while true quality falls.

      why: "The RLHF objective has a closed-form optimum, so the reward can be written as β·log π/π_ref. Substituting into the Bradley–Terry model gives a supervised loss on preference pairs. You still need pairs, a reference model and usually an SFT starting point.",

        "Always put the better answer first",
        "Ask twice with the order swapped and keep only verdicts that agree",
        "Use a smaller judge model",
        "Ignore it — position bias averages out",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      why: "Position bias turns order into a hidden input. Evaluating both orders exposes it: consistent verdicts reflect the answers, inconsistent ones reflect the order and should be dropped or sent to a person.",
    },

    {
      q: "Llama 4 Maverick has about 400B total parameters and 17B active per token. At 8-bit, roughly how much memory do its weights need?",
      options: ["About 17 GB", "About 400 GB", "About 34 GB", "It depends only on context length"],
      answer: 1,
      why: "Any token can be routed to any expert, so every expert must be resident. MoE gives you the compute cost of the active size and the memory cost of the total size.",
    },
    {
      q: "Why does a full-HD screenshot cost so many more tokens than a small thumbnail when sent to a VLM?",
      options: [
        "Larger files are billed by the megabyte",
        "The image is cut into fixed-size patches, and each patch (or small group) becomes a token",
        "Screenshots contain hidden text",
        "VLMs re-encode images several times",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      why: "Tokens scale with the number of patches, which scales with pixel area. That is why cropping to the relevant region is the cheapest optimisation for vision workloads.",
    },
    {
      q: "Chinchilla suggests about 20 training tokens per parameter, yet Llama 3 8B was trained on 15 trillion tokens. Why?",
      options: [
        "Chinchilla was wrong",
        "The extra data was mostly duplicates",
        "Serving cost dominates: a smaller model trained longer is cheaper to run for billions of requests",
        "Bigger datasets make models smaller",
      ],
      answer: 2,
      why: "Chinchilla's rule optimises the training budget alone. Once a model will be used heavily, spending more on training to get a smaller model that is just as good saves far more at inference time.",
    },
    {
      q: "In a large dense LLM such as Llama 3 70B, where do most of the parameters live?",
      options: ["The embedding table", "The attention layers", "The MLP (feed-forward) layers", "The tokenizer"],
      answer: 2,
      why: "Each block's MLP expands to a hidden size several times the model width with three weight matrices, so the MLPs hold roughly two-thirds of the parameters. The vocabulary is a small share in big models.",
    },
    {
      q: "What does a Large Concept Model predict at each step?",
      options: [
        "The next token",
        "The next sentence, as a vector in a language-independent embedding space",
        "The next action on screen",
        "A probability for each answer you supply",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      why: "Meta's LCM works on sentence embeddings (SONAR), then a decoder writes each sentence out — in any supported language. It is a research prototype, not a production architecture.",
    },
    {
      q: "An action model completes each step correctly 95% of the time. Roughly how often does it finish a 20-step task?",
      options: ["95%", "About 80%", "About 36%", "About 5%"],
      answer: 2,
      why: "Errors compound: 0.95²⁰ ≈ 0.36. This is why agents check the result of each action and recover from mistakes rather than relying on per-step accuracy alone.",
    },
    {
      q: "Which statement about model 'types' is accurate?",
      options: [
        "A model is exactly one type — LLM, VLM, SLM or MoE",
        "They describe different axes — size, architecture, input, output — so one model can be several at once",
        "MoE models cannot read images",
        "Small models are always dense",
      ],
      answer: 1,
      why: "Gemma 4 26B A4B, for example, is a mixture of experts, relatively small, and multimodal. The labels answer different questions about the same model.",
    },
